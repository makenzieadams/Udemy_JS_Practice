Variable is a way to store data for later and use them later

Data Type = refers to different types of data you can work with

YOU CAN'T DEFINE A VARIABLE MORE THAN ONCE:
To actually change a variable to something different take off the variable definition i.e "let"
example: instead of let dog = cash, let dog = apollo;
do let dog = 'cash', dog = apollo and dog will change to apollo

Variable name has to start with a letter OR $ (dollar sign) or \_ (underscore) NOTHING ELSE

Booleans: True or False
Comparison Operators:
-equality operator: ===
-not equal operator: !==

-If Statements: provide 2 things: condition, goes in (), & code to run, goes in {}, if condition is satisfied
-if (runs first), else(runs if first is false), else if(runs if both are false)

And/Or Statements: chain together multiple comparison operators to create a more complex condition
-And: True if BOTH sides are true, false if not
-Or: True is ONE at least ONE argument is true
